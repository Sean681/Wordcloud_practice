       "'Manchester City are interested in signing Cristiano Ronaldo from Juventus, according to Sky in Italy. City are willing to offer Ronaldo a two-year contract, with a salary of £12.8m-per-season (€15m), and would like to sign the Portugal captain for free. But Juventus want at least £21.4m (€25m) as a transfer fee and no formal offer has been made yet. The 36-year-old, who scored 118 goals in 292 games for Manchester United between 2003 and 2009, has been linked with a move away from the Allianz Stadium this summer and is understood to be open to leaving, but Juventus expect him to stay. Ronaldo has not directly communicated to the club that he wants to depart. His current contract at the Allianz Stadium runs until June 2022 and he is earning €31m per year after tax. City are the only club currently interested in signing Ronaldo, with Paris Saint-Germain not in the picture. Ronaldo\\'s representatives are pushing for a move, while Juventus would like to sign Gabriel Jesus to be a part of the deal, but City do not want to sell the Brazil international forward.

The 2021/22 UEFA Champions League group stage draw will take place from 5pm (BST) on Thursday August 26. The draw ceremony is being held in Istanbul, Turkey. Twenty-six teams qualified automatically for the Champions League group stage via their 2020/21 league position, while six further teams will book their places after Wednesday\\'s play-offs. The Premier League has four representatives at the group stage. The 32 teams will be split into four seeding pots for Thursday\\'s draw. Pot 1 will consist of the holders, Chelsea, Europa League winners, Villarreal, and the champions of the six highest-ranked nations who did not qualify via one of the 2020/21 continental titles. Pots 2 to 4 will be determined by club coefficient rankings. No team can play a side from their own league at this stage, meaning there will be no all-English ties until the knockout phase. UEFA will confirm any other restrictions ahead of the draw ceremony. Holders Chelsea and Premier League champions Manchester City will be drawn from Pot 1, while Manchester United and Liverpool will be drawn from Pot 2. Chelsea and City, last season\\'s finalists, could be drawn against the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus or Paris Saint-Germain in the group stage, while United and Liverpool could draw Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich or Inter Milan, the respective reigning Spanish, German and Italian champions.

Southampton demolished Newport 8-0 in the Carabao Cup to register the biggest away win in the club\\'s history. What had been viewed as a tricky assignment given Newport\\'s reputation as giant-killers turned into a cakewalk as Saints improved on various 6-0 away wins down the years. Mohamed Elyounoussi grabbed a hat-trick and Armando Broja scored twice, while Nathan Tella, Kyle Walker-Peters and Nathan Redmond also netted as Saints cruised into round three. They head to Championship side Sheffield United. Newport manager Michael Flynn was absent after testing positive for coronavirus and the architect of so many cup upsets was sorely missed by the Exiles. Rodney Parade has been a graveyard for several Premier League teams in recent years, but a new pristine playing surface being used for the first time was perfect for Southampton. Saints had boosted their defensive ranks in the previous 24 hours or so with Torino central defender Lyanco and Everton full-back Thierry Small moving to St Mary\\'s. But the tie came too soon for the pair to be involved as boss Ralph Hasenhuttl made nine changes from the side which drew at home to Manchester United on Sunday. Skipper James Ward-Prowse and defender Jack Stephens were the only players retained as League Two Newport welcomed back a meaningful crowd for the first time since March 2020. Elyounoussi had already signalled Saints\\' attacking intent before Broja marked his loan arrival from Chelsea with a debut goal after nine minutes. Redmond\\'s pile-driver was touched onto the bar by Newport goalkeeper Nick Townsend and Albania striker Broja tucked away the rebound from close range. The excellent Redmond was pulling Southampton strings and it was his 25th-minute pass to Elyounoussi that started the move which Tella finished confidently. Walker-Peters and Redmond should have put the visitors out of sight before the former did as the game approached half-time. The ball was quickly switched to the left for Walker-Peters to fire low and hard inside the near post - the full-back\\'s second senior goal and his first in Southampton colours. Elyounoussi struck twice soon after the break before Broja\\'s classy finish made it six. Redmond added a seventh after 69 minutes and Elyounoussi completed his hat-trick with the final kick as Southampton matched their biggest victory since World War I. The £250,000 is up for grabs with Super 6, and as always it is completely free to play. Entries by 3pm Saturday. Pep Guardiola has suggested he could leave Manchester City when his current contract runs out in 2023. The 50-year-old Spaniard, who joined City in 2016 and has won three Premier League titles, feels he may need a rest after seven years in charge. The former Barcelona boss revealed his next ambition is to take charge of a national team. \"Next step will be a national team, if there is a possibility,\" he said at an XP Investimentos event on Wednesday. \"After seven years on this team, I think I\\'m going to have a stop. I\\'m going to have to take a break, see what we\\'ve done. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"And in the process, I would like to coach a South American (team), European, playing a Copa America, I want to have that experience.\" Guardiola took a 12-month break following his departure from Barcelona in 2012 after four years at the Nou Camp, and joined Bayern Munich in 2013. His comments come on the day City\\'s pursuit of Harry Kane ended, with the England captain confirming he would be staying at Tottenham this summer. Arsenal got their season up and running by coasting to victory in their second-round Carabao Cup tie at West Brom - with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hitting a hat-trick on his return to the side. With pressure building on manager Mikel Arteta already after two defeats at the start of the new Premier League campaign, there was welcome relief as the Gunners smashed their hosts 6-0, setting up a third-round tie against League One side AFC Wimbledon. Aubameyang had been struck down by Covid on the eve of the new season, missing the loss at Brentford and coming off the bench in the defeat to Chelsea. He will not have scored many easier goals than the first-half double he grabbed here before adding a fine third for the match ball as Nicolas Pepe, Bukayo Saka and Alexandre Lacazette also found the back of the net. Saka was lively and Martin Odegaard impressed on his second debut for the club following his permanent switch from Real Madrid last week - but Arteta and his side will not be judged on such tests as this. While the Arsenal starting XI boasted 348 senior international caps and three national captains in Aubameyang, Odegaard and Granit Xhaka - West Brom made 11 changes from their win at Blackburn, handing out five debuts with an average age of under 23. Aaron Ramsdale made his Arsenal debut in goal and got off to a shaky start with his feet in front of an unfamiliar back four, which included Sead Kolasinac at centre-back. He did, however, make a smart low save to keep out Tom Fellows\\' low strike as the hosts started well - only to fall behind on 17 minutes. Saka\\'s smart feet saw him evade a number of challenges before his low shot was pushed out into the feet of Aubameyang, who tucked home from close-range for Arsenal\\'s first goal of the campaign. Odegaard should have marked his second debut with a goal but hit the post from a tight angle with the goal gaping. The tie was wrapped up as Arsenal scored two in quick succession on the stroke of half-time. First, Aubameyang doubled his tally for the night as he tapped home after Pepe hit the post following a fine Mohamed Elneny pass. Then he turned provider, seeing his own shot saved before his acrobatic shot fell to Pepe who slid in to finish. Saka got his name on the scoresheet soon after the restart, finishing with aplomb following a fine flick from Odegaard. Lacazette opened his account for the season just four minutes into his first appearance, tucking home at the front post as Pepe claimed another assist. That was the end of the rout as Arteta enjoyed a fine evening all round ahead of Saturday\\'s trip to reigning Premier League champions and Carabao Cup holders Manchester City. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Mikel Arteta on Sky Sports Football: \"It\\'s always a tough place to come here midweek. They made some changes to to keep the clean sheet and with the attitude the team had, overall I\\'m very happy. We\\'re really disappointed we haven\\'t won yet in the Premier League, but the players are together. \"When you lose the most important thing is to win the next match as quickly as possible, score some good goals and get some confidence, and get a clean sheet. There were players that needed goals and minutes, so in general it was a very positive night. \"Aubameyang looked sharp. Physically he\\'s not at his best but he looked good tonight. He can play outside, inside. It depends on the plan of the game and who we have available. Martin gives us something different and Ramsdale looked very comfortable.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Andy Hinchcliffe on Sky Sports Football: \"He benefitted from some poor defending but he took his chances. Arsenal are transformed as an attacking force when he plays. Four shots, three goals.

Entries by 3pm Saturday. West Ham remain in talks with Chelsea over a deal to sign Kurt Zouma but the move is proving complicated and problematic to complete. Personal terms and the structure of the payment have been the biggest obstacles during talks between the two Premier League sides. The clubs are negotiating a fee in the region of £25m for the France international, who has not featured in either of Chelsea\\'s Premier League games so far this season, and all parties involved are hopeful a deal can still be done. Zouma has been David Moyes\\'s primary target for defensive strengthening all summer, although the Hammers have also been linked with Fiorentina\\'s Nikola Milenkovic and Marseille\\'s Duje Caleta-Car, and the club are keeping all options open in their recruitment for a central defender. The 26-year-old has been with Chelsea since January 2014, when he joined the club from Saint-Etienne. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Zouma scored five goals last season, which was one of his most prolific in terms of appearances until Thomas Tuchel took over as head coach from Frank Lampard. He was an unused substitute in the opening two Premier League games of this season, wins over Crystal Palace and Arsenal - but did start the Super Cup clash with Villarreal. West Ham would need Zouma registered by midday on Friday for him to be available for their clash with Palace this weekend. Zouma\\'s departure could lead to the arrival of another defender, with Chelsea having consistently been linked with Sevilla\\'s Jules Kounde. Sky Sports News reported last month that Kounde, one of Europe\\'s most promising defenders, and Chelsea had been in talks but he remains a Sevilla player for now and has started both of their LaLiga games this season.

The midfielder arrived for his medical on Tuesday and has agreed an initial loan switch, with the Serie A club holding an option to buy Torreira for £12.8m at the end of the season. The Uruguay international, who is currently not in Mikel Arteta\\'s plans, decided on a return to Italy having joined Arsenal from Sampdoria in 2018. Eintracht Frankfurt also made an offer for the 25-year-old earlier in the transfer window. Torreira will wear the No 18 shirt for Fiorentina, who finished 13th in the Italian top-flight last season and began their 2021/22 campaign with a 3-1 defeat to Roma. 1⃣8⃣ Our new number 18 ⚜️#ForzaViola 💜 #Fiorentina #ACFFiorentina #Torreira pic.twitter.com/x1kfj39cnQ He has made 89 appearances for the Gunners and scored four goals.

Former England international Lennon joined Burnley from Everton in 2018 and played 41 Premier League matches, scoring once, before leaving two years later.

Meanwhile, Lyon have accepted Burnley\\'s £15m offer for Ivory Coast left-back Maxwel Cornet. The Turf Moor club have also signed goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey plus centre-backs Nathan Collins and Jacob Bedeau this summer, while Ben Gibson has departed to join Norwich and Bailey Peacock-Farrell and Lukas Jensen have been loaned out.

Tottenham striker Harry Kane will remain at the club this summer after accepting he will not be joining Manchester City, and Jamie Redknapp says the news provides a major boost for the chasing pack. The England captain was desperate to join the Premier League champions, but they got nowhere near the asking price as Spurs refused to sell. So how big a blow is it to Manchester City\\'s hopes of finally ending their wait to win the Champions League while retaining their Premier League title? Sky Sports\\' Jamie Redknapp reflects on the summer\\'s drawn-out transfer saga and what happens next... Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  It\\'s a huge blow for Manchester City. They\\'ve left themselves in a bit of a difficult position now. They\\'ve obviously lost Sergio Aguero, they\\'ve got Gabriel Jesus but they won the league last season without a recognised striker and they have so many other attacking options. I just have a feeling that this year with crowds back, it\\'s going to be harder than ever to win away from home. There will be a bit more pressure on you to attack and the impetus is going to be there. I think this is a huge blow for them but they must have a contingency plan. City must be thinking there is someone else they can sign because if they were to lose Jesus, it\\'s going to leave them extremely short. I\\'d be amazed if they didn\\'t get someone in during this window. This is great news for Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea because I think that pretty much everyone in football would\\'ve thought had Kane gone to City, you might as well do the trophy lift now. But Kane staying at Spurs gives a completely different perspective to the whole season. It doesn\\'t make Man City the outstanding favourites.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  I think Kane will just get on with it. Harry is a consummate professional. He got a bit of criticism for how he didn\\'t return back from his holiday for training but that\\'s something that happens with players. I\\'ve seen players do 10 times worse, but since he\\'s come back into the fold he\\'s got on with it. I never really wanted a relationship with my owner. I had no interest. When I was at Liverpool, the owner didn\\'t feature unless you were signing a contract. At some clubs, the relationship between the owner, manager and the players seems a lot closer but it\\'s not something I liked having. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  From Kane\\'s point of view, all he\\'ll be concerned with is scoring goals for Tottenham and achieving success this season. It\\'s his club. His entire family adores Spurs and it\\'s a really difficult situation for him. As a kid, he\\'d have never wanted to leave but he didn\\'t feel the club was going in the right direction and the ambition wasn\\'t there. Maybe we\\'ll see something different now. We\\'ve got a week left of the window and they could get some players in. I\\'ve always said Tottenham have got a strong squad, but who knows what might happen. I\\'ve seen some footballers behave appallingly trying to get a move out of the club but Harry will be totally professional about the situation. Every player wants to win trophies so hopefully Levy can show some real ambition, not just by keeping Kane but through adding to the squad that can enable the side to finish in the top four, win an FA Cup and long-term he might think he is at the right club after all. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Harry has been pretty understanding of the situation. How I see it is that Manchester City made a huge offer of around £130m but Tottenham didn\\'t want to engage. That\\'s Daniel Levy\\'s prerogative and he said no as he doesn\\'t want to sell him. He doesn\\'t want him to leave right now and he wants the matter closed as soon as possible. As a professional, from Harry\\'s point of view, he\\'s going to have to get on with it. With a club like Manchester City, he wants to win trophies and he perhaps looked at Tottenham and they haven\\'t shown the ambition that he\\'s wanted. I think there was an agreement last year that if they didn\\'t win a trophy then Levy would sell him, but obviously that wasn\\'t the case. Daniel didn\\'t stick to that deal and has decided to keep him which is his prerogative. Once you sign a contract and they\\'re legally binding, there\\'s not a lot you can do, but everyone signs contracts. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  I\\'m sure Kylian Mbappe signed a contract at PSG but he\\'s still going to get sold. If he wants to go, he\\'ll get himself to a new club. Harry\\'s representatives have took a bit of stick for signing a long-term contract but most players want to sign long-term contracts and he was at a club he loves. If he ends up leaving next summer, I\\'m still sure he\\'d be welcomed back as a Tottenham legend but these things happen in football. Where Tottenham are extremely fortunate is that they\\'ve got an incredible professional who wants to break records and he\\'ll want to break Alan Shearer\\'s goalscoring record. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  He\\'ll get back into the fold and show everyone what a professional he is. He\\'ll score 20-plus goals again this season. We\\'ve seen with other players how Steven Gerrard nearly went to Chelsea and John Terry was close to joining Manchester City. They ended up staying at their clubs and went on to be absolute legends. Sensible people in football will say that Kane has done everything he can for Tottenham, ambition hasn\\'t been shown and the players that he wants haven\\'t been signed. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  I don\\'t think it is, but it depends how you look at it. Next year, Erling Haaland might be leaving Borussia Dortmund, Manchester United might need a striker so Daniel Levy might think he could get the £150m next year. It\\'s a brave move as a year and a half ago clubs were putting staff on furlough. Tottenham are now turning down £130m so it just shows you the vast amount of money within football. Tottenham are clearly in a good financial position if they\\'re turning down this amount of money. The fans will be delighted and as soon as Harry scores his next goal for Tottenham, they will all get on with it. The matter for now will be put to bed. But if Harry still isn\\'t happy next year, I\\'ve got no doubt at all that if the possibility of a move came around again with two years left on his contract, it might be a different conversation. Time will tell. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News\\' Kaveh Solhekol on The Transfer Show: \"Cristiano Ronaldo is available at the moment. Juventus would like to sell him in the next six days if at all possible, and he would like to leave the club. He has been linked, especially in the Italian media, with a move to Manchester City. \"My understanding of the situation is that Cristiano Ronaldo is not a player whose profile fits Manchester City\\'s plans and strategy at the moment. But, I would not rule it out 100 per cent because there are only six days left of the window and if somebody was to put an incredible deal in front of City, then I think they\\'d look at it. \"He\\'s not the right profile, age and we know of his history with Manchester United but City are one of the biggest clubs in the world and they get offered players all the time. If there\\'s a deal that makes sense to them financially and from a sporting perspective then they will look at it. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"Manchester City don\\'t normally make late moves in the transfer market. Everything they do is usually very well-prepared. \"I think if something crops up in the next few days, they will look at it and if it makes sense for them then they may make a move but as things stand, there wasn\\'t really a Plan B. They wanted to sign Kane at a fair price. \"If you look at City\\'s history, they do not pay over the odds for players even though they are a very rich club. Quite frequently, if they feel a deal is not right and if they feel a player is over-valued, they walk away. They didn\\'t sign Harry Maguire, Fred, Alexis Sanchez or Jorginho and this case is the same.\" Ferran Torres Torres arrived from Valencia in 2020 as a winger, but has slowly adapted to a role up front with City. Now the Spain international looks likely to have first refusal on the central role under Guardiola if the club do not bring in a late recruit. Former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville told Sky Sports this week he believes Torres can fill that attacking spearhead role if required. Gabriel Jesus The Brazil striker would in the past have been the more obvious man to fill the number nine role, but has spent a sizeable amount of time on the flanks in recent times. Brazil have deployed Jesus on the wing, and Guardiola and the man himself both appear happy to continue that trend in City blue. Liam Delap Guardiola has already disappointed a host of suitors by confirming 18-year-old striker Delap will not go on loan this term. Former Stoke midfielder Rory\\'s son, Delap junior has a fine goalscoring pedigree from youth and U23 football and will spend the season in and around the City first-team set-up.

Wolves are interested in Marseille centre-back Duje Caleta-Car but face an uphill task to convince the player to join them. The Croatia international wants to keep playing in European competition if he is to leave the French club this summer. Marseille need to sell players to offset the cost of the Covid-19 pandemic and are said to be willing to sell for a fee in the region of £17m (€20m). Wolves want to sign another centre-back before the deadline and could intensify their pursuit of Caleta-Car if they are given any new encouragement from the player or Marseille. The 24-year-old has also been on West Ham\\'s list of targets - but they are close to agreeing a deal to sign Kurt Zouma from Chelsea - David Moyes\\'s primary target.

He has scored three goals and made two assists in almost 100 appearances for Marseille, where he still has two years remaining on his contract. Wolves and Watford are interested in signing Celta Vigo\\'s Okay Yokuslu. One source has told Sky Sports News that Watford are preparing to make a bid for the Turkey international. Yokuslu is said to be valued by the Spanish club in the region of just £5m and is keen to return to the Premier League. He impressed on loan at West Brom last season despite their relegation, making 16 appearances in all competitions.

Trent Alexander-Arnold and Mason Greenwood are set to be recalled to the England squad for next month\\'s World Cup qualifiers. Both players missed Euro 2020 - where England reached the final before being beaten by Italy on penalties - after suffering injuries before the tournament. But the pair have started the season well after returning to fitness, with Greenwood scoring in both of Manchester United\\'s Premier League games, and Alexander-Arnold helping Liverpool keep back-to-back clean sheets. Gareth Southgate will name his squad for the fixtures against Hungary, Andorra and Poland on Thursday. Although he was named in Southgate\\'s expanded squad ahead of Euro 2020 before having to pull out through injury, Greenwood has not played for his country since September 2020, when he was sent home after breaching coronavirus protocols after a game in Iceland. Alexander-Arnold has featured more regularly for England - representing his country four times last season - but is likely to face strong competition at right-back from Kyle Walker, Reece James and Kieran Trippier. Harry Kane, who on Wednesday confirmed he will be staying at Tottenham this summer despite informing the club he wanted to leave during the current transfer window, is also set to be named in the squad. Spurs have rebuffed Manchester City\\'s attempts to sign Kane, but it is understood Southgate was planning to include his captain in his squad even if he was engaged in negotiations over a transfer up until Tuesday\\'s deadline. Arrangements would have been made to allow Kane to complete a medical or travel off-site to conclude any possible deal if it occurred after the England squad meets up following this weekend\\'s Premier League fixtures. Kane returned to Tottenham for pre-season later than planned - although he denied refusing to train - and was further delayed after being forced to quarantine following his arrival from Barbados, via Florida. He missed Spurs\\' opening two games of the season, but proved his fitness by coming off the bench in the second half of their 1-0 win at Wolves on Sunday - his first action since the Euro 2020 final. Southgate is planning to name his strongest possible squad for the qualifiers, with Hungary and Poland likely to be England\\'s toughest opponents in Group I. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The first of the three games will take place in Budapest on September 2, before Andorra travel to Wembley three days later. England round off their fixtures against Poland in Warsaw on September 8. The bulk of the squad will be similar to that which took England to the final of Euro 2020 at Wembley 45 days ago, although Nick Pope is set to return after injury also ruled him out of the competition. However, Southgate will be limited to calling up only 23 players, rather than the 26 he was allowed for the Euros. Each team will be able to make five substitutions per game during the qualifiers. Regardless of any positive change in travel status, there will be a cauldron of partisan support in Budapest and Warsaw as no away fans will be permitted. \\n\\n\\nFIFA and UEFA took the decision earlier this month that international matches in Europe during September should not host visiting supporters because of a \"spike\" in Covid-19 cases. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the England Supporters Travel Club, 7 thousand applications of interest were made for tickets for the Hungary fixture. A further 6 thousand registering to apply for a ticket for the Poland game, so supporter could be enticed to travel regardless of their inability to get into the stadium.  Marcus Rashford, who was among those to miss penalties in the final shoot-out, will not be in the squad after undergoing surgery on a long-standing shoulder issue earlier this month. Phil Foden is another Euro 2020 squad member who will miss out as the playmaker recovers from a foot injury, while goalkeeper Dean Henderson is building fitness after contracting Covid-19 last month. Danny Ings has begun his Aston Villa career in goal scoring form - including that spectacular overhead kick in the win over Newcastle. And what about Dele Alli? Over two years now since his last International appearance, his early season form in a deeper midfield role for Tottenham has shown promise. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Dean Henderson\\'s continuing absence means Sam Johnstone and Aaron Ramsdale are likely to be Jordan Pickford\\'s goalkeeping support. However, there will be question marks over Ben White and Ben Chilwell. White is currently recovering from Covid-19 after missing Arsenal\\'s defeat to Chelsea and is a significant doubt for their clash with Manchester City this weekend. Ben Chilwell didn\\'t play a minute for England at Euro 2020 - and was sidelined after being deemed a close contact following Billy Gilmour\\'s positive Covid-19 test during the tournament. So far, Chilwell hasn\\'t featured for Chelsea this season - with Thomas Tuchel opting for Marcos Alonso. England’s three World Cup Qualifiers in September involve trips to Hungary and Poland, with a home game against Andorra sandwiched in between. \\n\\n\\nAt this stage, there are no concerns regarding the release of players for Gareth Southgate’s squad as both Hungary and Poland are on the UK’s amber list. \\n\\n\\nThe Government’s next travel review is imminent – and reports suggest both nations could move to the green list, deemed among the safest to travel.   As Southgate prepares to name his squad, we have compiled an England XI from the stats-based Sky Sports Power Rankings this season and there are some surprise selections - albeit from a limited number of games played. Saint-Etienne\\'s aptly named \\'keeper Etienne Green kicks up the first shock in goal by ousting current England No 1 Jordan Pickford and Nick Pope - having recently revealed a desire to play for his homeland. Former Premier League starlets Reece Oxford and Fikayo Timori earn centre-back starting berths - having started the campaign in stellar style for AC Milan and FC Augsburg, respectively. Alexander-Arnold missed Euro 2020 through injury but the 22-year-old has kicked off the season with form to warrant inclusion, while West Ham\\'s Aaron Cresswell occupies the left flank after carrying his form from last term into the new campaign. A more familiar trio are pencilled into a three-man midfield, with Declan Rice holding centrally, flanked by Mason Mount and Jack Grealish - although Southgate is unlikely to play Manchester City\\'s £100m recruit in that deeper role. Up top, man of the moment Michail Antonio becomes the third West Ham player to make the XI after his explosive start with three goals in two games. Antonio has chosen to represent Jamaica but has not made yet made his international debut for them. As such, he remains eligible to be selected by England at this time. Meanwhile, Greenwood and Montpellier and former Arsenal forward Stephy Mavididi earns a debut down the left.

Whilst reaffirming his desire to lead the team to Qatar 2022, Southgate spoke about the emotional toll the tournament had taken on him and his players - and the need for rest, recuperation and reflection. Has he watched the final back? If so what lessons has he taken? There\\'s no doubt a manager as diligent at Southgate, aided by Steve Holland and a host of skilled coaches and video staff, will seek to learn from that disappointing night in July. But, is the message now to forget and move on? To ensure this generation of players are not scared by the biggest of \\'\\'what ifs?\\'\\' Southgate staunchly supported Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Bukayo Saka following their penalty shoot-out misses. He will have been heartened by the applause for Saka from Brentford, Tottenham and Chelsea fans already this season - but Sancho and Rashford have been targeted by for abuse from some supporters.

Harry Kane has revealed he will be staying at Tottenham this summer, following months of speculation about his future. Here, Sky Sports News reporter Paul Gilmour, who has covered the story closely, answers key questions on what it means and what comes next... How much of a surprise was it to see Harry Kane confirm he would be staying at Tottenham this summer, given Manchester City\\'s long pursuit of him?  Paul Gilmour: When a player like Harry Kane, with the type of contract he\\'s on, expresses a wish to leave, it\\'s a case of anything can happen. In this specific case, given it is Daniel Levy involved as Tottenham chairman, and his reputation, and the fact that it emerged there was no release clause in his contract, then that would have been a really worrying sign for Harry Kane. So in the back of his mind, he would have always felt that this was a possibility. And that\\'s how it\\'s turned out. He will be staying. It\\'s a massive, massive boost for Tottenham and for Levy, especially after the European Super League fallout. Daniel Levy will be the toughest opponent Manchester City face this season. We\\'re being told Kane held really positive talks with director of football Fabio Paratici and the management team that are in place at the moment - head coach Nuno Espirito Santo and Paratici, director of technical performance Steve Hitchen and Levy - they\\'ve found a way to convince Kane. It was incredible to see the reception from the Spurs fans on Sunday and to read some of the messages of support I\\'ve had in the last few weeks. 👏⚽I will be staying at Tottenham this summer and will be 100% focused on helping the team achieve success. #COYS pic.twitter.com/uTN78tHlk1 He does not want to be playing in the Europa Conference League, he wants to be in the Champions League, he wants to be going for Premier League titles. He wants Tottenham to be ambitious, he wants to do all of that, ideally, at Tottenham. It\\'s become clear over the last couple of years that it\\'s been a world away from the days of the Champions League final under Mauricio Pochettino. It hasn\\'t felt like that for Kane. So to be able to get him to get his head down and get on with it this season is a major achievement. I don\\'t think there\\'s any concern whatsoever that Harry Kane won\\'t be professional. The information we\\'re getting is that Kane loves Tottenham too much for that. Yes, he wanted away, he wanted to try and have those personal ambitions but there\\'s going to be no problem with him getting his head down and being professional. I don\\'t think there are going to be any issues with a lack of concentration or his mind being elsewhere, as it would be with some other players. His respect for the club and the club fan base, especially, would mean that he\\'s going to give everything. What happens beyond the season, that\\'s another question. A lot has been made of the wording of the tweet about \\'this summer\\'. Whether he does sign a new contract that suddenly has a release clause, is that a possible compromise? That\\'s all stuff that will come in the future. We don\\'t know, at this stage. But in terms of the immediate priority of this season, it\\'s a good day for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. The wording of Kane\\'s tweet is interesting. \\'...this summer…\\' has led to speculation Man City or other clubs could come in again for Kane in January or this time next year. Nuno has said \"It\\'s finished\". Is it? Gilmour: Nothing has changed in the sense that Kane wants to go for the major titles. He wants to be in teams that are challenging for leagues and the cups. He just wants Tottenham to show ambition. He wants Tottenham to progress and be of a level that he wants to be at. The Tottenham players got a real taste for that in the Champions League final. He wants more of that and if Tottenham are way off the pace, then that\\'s the driving factor for him wanting away for the last year or so. What good might come of this from a Kane perspective is, we\\'ve seen some players move on this summer, we\\'ve seen Paratici come in with a new manager as well. So is there a chance to start building something and start trying to work towards something? To try and clear out some of the players who maybe don\\'t quite fit into that way the club wants to go and can they try and get back to being competitive? Can they try and qualify for the Champions League this season? Football is difficult to predict sometimes. Football changes. Sometimes in football, the immediacy is just as important because we can\\'t predict what will happen to them. Who\\'s to say this time next year Tottenham have qualified for the Champions League and they\\'re playing great football and Kane is scoring goals and everyone\\'s happy and everyone\\'s throwing plaudits Tottenham\\'s way? There\\'s no guarantee that won\\'t be the case - although, equally, they could have another season like they did last year and it\\'s even more of a problem. Nobody can predict what way football is going to go so that\\'s why getting him on board and drawing a line under this for all parties is just a really positive development from a club point of view. Next summer Erling Haaland has a release clause of £64m. Next summer Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe are available on free transfers. Next summer Kane will turn 29. Do those circumstances suggest he has missed his chance for a big move away from Tottenham?  Gilmour: It is possible but again circumstances can change so much in football that everything is different again by this time next summer. If you remember back in May, when we first reported that Kane had told Daniel Levy he wanted to leave this summer, the three clubs that wanted to sign him were Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea. Now Chelsea, that was always a non-starter given the rivalry of the clubs and that Chelsea have since got sorted with Romelu Lukaku. But one thing I\\'ve been told consistently is United might be in a better position to go for someone like Kane next summer. If Kane\\'s still a Tottenham player this season then Manchester United come into play more for next summer. So there\\'s always something else that crops up and a lot of it depends on strikers elsewhere and where they go. Where will Haaland go, for example, that might just have an impact on where Kane ends up. So it\\'s fascinating but it\\'s one of those ones where we have to wait and see how that domino effect begins to take shape over the next six months to a year. Tottenham fans were protesting outside the Spurs stadium, calling for Daniel Levy to resign at the end of last season, following news of the failed European Super League. But has this situation been a good example of what a good businessman he is, in terms of looking after Tottenham\\'s key assets? Gilmour: Levy\\'s job is to have the best interests of the club at heart. That\\'s what he does. He looks after the club. And selling off a player who had so many goal involvements last season clearly wasn\\'t in the best interest of the club and he was clearly never going to sell him on the cheap either. And Kane didn\\'t expect to be sold on the cheap. He completely understood the fact that he has three years remaining and yes, he maybe had a view of how much he could go for, as he said in that interview, but he also understood as time wore on, and Daniel Levy\\'s position became ultra clear, there was an understanding that just because he wanted to leave didn\\'t mean he had a right to go on the cheap. And that\\'s the way it\\'s played out. Harry Kane is staying. Spurs have two wins from two Premier League games, Dele Alli and Steven Bergwijn look rejuvenated, youngsters Oliver Skipp and Japhet Tanganga are impressing, Cristian Romero and Bryan Gil have joined... Is there cause for optimism around the club now? Gilmour: It seems like there\\'s been a bit more of a plan with Paratici coming in. Dele Alli has really put in the work over the summer and you can tell that because he has come in and looks rejuvenated and refreshed since the days of Jose Mourinho, where it just didn\\'t quite click for him and Mourinho. You\\'ve got all these new signings coming in and things will probably feel a bit more optimistic, especially as they try and move on players who don\\'t want to be there. But it seems like they\\'re starting to make moves and shaping a squad that\\'s going to be competitive. We just don\\'t know how that squad gels and how new signings settle in. But the early stages of the season have shown plenty of promise.

Celtic manager Ange Postecoglou insists there will be no change to their attacking outlook in their Europa League play-off away to AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, despite his side taking a 2-0 lead into the second leg in the Netherlands. Celtic\\'s victory in the first game at Parkhead was their fifth successive win, and they extended that run to six matches with a 6-0 thrashing of St Mirren at home on Saturday. Postecoglou\\'s team have scored 24 goals in those six games and he insists his players will look to maintain that impressive record and press home their advantage against AZ. \"I think that is the best approach from us,\" said the Hoops manager, who admits the club are still \"talking to a number of targets\". \"If we go there and try to defend for 90 minutes, I just think you are asking for trouble.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  The Ibrox club handed out indefinite bans to supporters after a social media video showed travelling fans singing racist songs about the Hoops\\' Japanese forward. The footage emerged on Sunday afternoon when Rangers were in Dingwall for a 4-2 win over Ross County. The Govan club investigated the incident and have also taken action against the supporters club which organised the tickets and coach trip to the Highlands. Asked if he was impressed with Rangers\\' swift response, Postecoglou said: \"It doesn\\'t matter who it involves, we don\\'t need to be impressed. It just has to happen. \"I don\\'t think Rangers acted because they wanted to impress anyone. I would like to think people see right and wrong and just deal with it. \"This doesn\\'t need endless debates on radio or television on what should happen and why it happened. It is wrong, we know it is wrong. \"It is not something someone sees any grey in. I would be surprised because we all understand how people in that situation feel when you are the victim of something like this. \"They did the right thing in dealing with it and whoever else it happens to or whoever else wants to transgress - whatever organisation they are involved in - I expect it to be dealt with the same way. \"Just simple, deal with it and when the consequences come that quickly and without too much debate, I think people start to realise maybe a line has been drawn and we shouldn\\'t really conduct ourselves in this way anymore.\" Postecoglou admits he can only hope Furuhashi, who signed from Vissel Kobe in July, has been unaffected. The former Australia boss said: \"He\\'s good to go, absolutely. Has he been affected? It\\'s hard because unless you - it\\'s the old adage - walk a mile in a person\\'s shoes, how do you really know? \"He\\'s a really positive character, he is really enjoying his time here - not just the football but living here in a new country and a new experience. \"And when 99 per cent of your experience is overwhelmingly positive, that one per cent - I hope anyway because I feel responsible and protective of him - doesn\\'t affect his overall outlook. \"But it is easy for me to say, it hasn\\'t been directed at me. But he is training well, he is a happy-natured guy and the club are supporting him, the players are certainly around him and he has been good. \"He understands this is not reflective of his experience here.\" The £250,000 is up for grabs with Super 6, and as always it is completely free to play.

The Government say they have no plans to change policy on arrivals from red list countries or force Premier League clubs to let players travel for World Cup qualifying matches in those areas. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to request exemptions for players due to play in red-list countries during the upcoming international break. But the Government have told Sky News that public health is their top priority and concerns over foreign variants mean there is no way the rules can be relaxed for professional footballers. Downing Street say this is different from Euro 2020 - when all the players were contained within specific bubbles and there was less travel involved. The Premier League announced on Tuesday that nearly 60 players from 19 clubs would not be released next week to fly off to World Cup qualifiers in 26 countries on the UK Government list. La Liga are also backing their clubs\\' decision not to release players for qualifiers in countries where the players would have to quarantine on their return. The Government states those returning to England from a country on their red list must quarantine for 10 full days in a managed quarantine hotel and take a coronavirus test on or before day two and on or after day eight of quarantining. But Infantino said in a Wednesday statement: \"We have faced global problems together in the past and must continue to do so in the future. \"The release of players in the upcoming international windows is a matter of great urgency and importance.\" Infantino called \"on a show of solidarity from every member association, every league and every club, to do what is both right and fair for the global game\". He added: \"Many of the best players in the world compete in leagues in England and Spain and we believe these countries also share the responsibility to preserve and protect the sporting integrity of competitions around the world. \"On the issue of quarantine restrictions in England, for players returning from red-list countries, I have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and appealed for the necessary support, in particular, so players are not deprived of the opportunity of representing their countries in qualifying matches for the FIFA World Cup, which is one of the ultimate honours for a professional footballer. \"I have suggested that an approach similar to that adopted by the UK government for the final stages of the Euro 2020 be implemented for the upcoming international matches. \"Together we have shown solidarity and unity in the fight against Covid-19. \"Now, I am urging everyone to ensure the release of international players for the upcoming FIFA World Cup qualifiers.\" The Confederation of African Football [CAF] has asked the British Government to grant an exemption for African players for the upcoming window. Their statement read in part: \"CAF has noted the current circumstances in place in Britain regarding the lack of sporting exemptions for players returning from several African countries after the international window next week. \"CAF notes that similar exemptions were granted by the British Government to enable the attendance of delegations and officials, amongst others, at the finals of the European Championship held less than two months ago. \"CAF has appealed as a matter of urgency, to the Football Association and the British Government, that the same treatment previously applied to Europe now be extended to Africa under the principles of solidarity and equal treatment.\" Argentina, Brazil and Egypt are among the nations currently on the UK Government\\'s red list regarding travel to England. The Premier League decision means Mohamed Salah would not be able to play in Egypt\\'s World Cup Qualifier in Cairo against Angola on September 2 - and the Egyptian FA had said Liverpool had already informed them Salah will not be available. Brazil host Argentina in a World Cup Qualifier at the Maracana on September 5, but the Premier League\\'s decision means numerous players will miss that match, and several other big games in South America. Eight Premier League players were named in the upcoming Brazil squad, with Liverpool trio Alisson Becker, Fabinho and Roberto Firmino joined by Ederson and Gabriel Jesus (both Manchester City), Thiago Silva (Chelsea), Fred (Manchester United), Richarlison (Everton) and Raphinha (Leeds United).

The FIFA president\\'s statement was released just minutes after the English Football League announced it was following the Premier League\\'s stance on players heading to red-list countries. A statement read: \"EFL clubs have today taken the collective decision not to release players for international matches that are to be played in countries on the UK Government\\'s \\'red list\\' next month. \"The EFL supports the decision of its clubs and is aligned with the position taken by our Premier League colleagues, who are also significantly impacted by this situation. \"The approach has been necessary as a result of FIFA\\'s policy change whereby clubs are now required to release players to countries that are on a Governmental red list, where previously there was an exemption.\" The Premier League statement had read in part: \"Extensive discussions have taken place with both the FA and the Government to find a solution, but due to ongoing public health concerns relating to incoming travellers from red-list countries, no exemption has been granted. \"If required to quarantine on return from red-list countries, not only would players\\' welfare and fitness be significantly impacted, but they would also be unavailable to prepare for and play in two Premier League match rounds, a UEFA club competition matchday and the third round of the EFL Cup. \"This period takes into consideration 10 days of hotel quarantine on return to England but does not include any additional time that would be required for players to regain match fitness.\" The £250,000 is up for grabs with Super 6, and as always it is completely free to play. Entries by 3pm Saturday. Southampton have completed the signing of Brazilian defender Lyanco from Torino on a four-year contract. The 24-year-old completed a medical on Monday and is understood to have also been subject to interest from Udinese and their sister club Watford over the summer. The centre-back played 23 games in Serie A last season, helping Torino avoid relegation to the second tier of Italian football as they finished 17th. Lyanco, who is a Brazil U23 international and was part of their Toulon Tournament-winning side in 2019, becomes Saints\\' eighth signing of the summer, with Adam Armstrong, Theo Walcott, Romain Perraud, Valentino Livramento, Dynel Simeu, and Thierry Small having joined permanently, while Armando Broja has arrived on loan from Chelsea. He said: \"I\\'m very happy to be here. It\\'s a dream that I have had since I started playing football as a child to play in the Premier League and for a team like Southampton. \"It\\'s a dream not only for me but for all my family too. Welcome to #SaintsFC, @Lyanco 🇧🇷 pic.twitter.com/bpr8vR1Xfs \"I grew up in Brazil and the football is different there, then when I went to Italy I learned that you have to be focused more on tactics. \"My dream was to play in the Premier League and play strong football, and for me English football is perfect.\" Torino did not include him in their squad for their opening match of the Serie A season, which they lost 2-1 at home to Atalanta. Lyanco moved to Italy from Sao Paulo in 2017 and enjoyed a loan spell at Bologna in the 2018/19 campaign. As well as his appearances for Brazil\\'s development teams, he also holds Serbian citizenship and has represented them at U19 level. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Ralph Hasenhuttl was eager to sign a central defender before the end of the window and Lyanco will likely fill a role left by Jannik Vestergaard who joined Premier League rivals Leicester City. Danny Ings, Angus Gunn, Mario Lemina and Ryan Bertrand have also departed, but the club have tied down captain James Ward-Prowse to a five-year deal after Aston Villa\\'s £25m approach for the midfielder was rejected. After their 3-1 defeat to Everton and a 1-1 draw with Manchester United in their first two games, Southampton face Newport County in the second round of the League Cup on Wednesday before a trip to Newcastle United in the Premier League on Saturday.

Entries by 3pm Saturday. Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Leonardo says the club have turned down Real Madrid\\'s €160m (£137m) bid for Kylian Mbappe despite the player making it clear he wants to leave. The France World Cup winner, 22, joined PSG from fellow Ligue 1 club Monaco for £166m in 2017 and is out of contract next summer. Mbappe has won three Ligue 1 titles and three French Cups at the Parc des Princes. \"Yes, we said no verbally to Real,\" Leonardo told RMC Sport. \"No one is being held back. If someone wants to leave and our conditions are met, we\\'ll see. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"The offer is considered to be a far cry from what Kylian is worth today. We also owe part of this money to Monaco and we consider that the bid is not sufficient.\" Mbappe, who has started all three of his side\\'s Ligue 1 games this season - scoring in a 4-2 win against Brest on Friday - has also promised PSG he will not leave for free, according to Leonardo. \"Kylian wants to leave, it seems clear to me. If Real Madrid makes an offer, it seems clear to me... I am taking a position which I think is clear to everyone. If he wants to leave, we are not going to hold him back, but it will be on our terms,\" the former PSG midfielder said. \"Kylian always promised that he would never leave the club for free. That\\'s what he\\'s always told us. \"We have no plans to talk to Real Madrid again. The deadline is August 31 at midnight. That\\'s how the transfer window is, but we are clear about this: we want to keep him and extend his deal. But we\\'re not going to let him go for less than what we paid for him, when we still owe Monaco money.\" PSG signed Argentina forward Lionel Messi earlier this month after he left Barcelona. Leonardo says the club has tried to prove to Mbappe that he is central to the club\\'s vision but not \"above the project\" with their offer of a new contract. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  \"Our position has always been to keep Kylian, to extend his deal, that has always been our goal and still is,\" the Brazilian added. \"We made two important offers to Kylian: one at the level of the top players in the squad two months ago, and one above these players very recently.\" Real Madrid are now considering whether to make an improved bid for Mbappe, although they believe their opening offer of €160m was fair given they can sign him on a free transfer next summer. The French forward - who will be able to sign a pre-contract agreement with Real on January 1 - wants to leave PSG and hopes the club will allow him to do so. However, Mbappe accepts negotiations could be drawn out until the end of the window, and he will continue to train professionally in the meantime. PSG have always been aware that Mbappe is a Real fan and that the club represents his dream move. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sky Sports News reporter Kaveh Solhekol: \"It\\'s time to get the popcorn out. War has broken out between two of the world\\'s biggest clubs. The background to this is that Mbappe has one year left on his contract while PSG are trying to get him to sign a new deal. \"The player himself wants to go to Real Madrid. Two days ago, Madrid made a bid of £137m even though he\\'s only got 12 months left on his contract. \"That bid has been verbally rejected and PSG are very unhappy about how Real have gone about this. The sporting director Leonardo has been speaking and he says the way Real have gone about this \\'we do not like at all\\'. PSG believe that what Madrid have wanted all along is to get the player for free next summer, so why have they made this bid? \"They\\'ve made it so late in the window knowing PSG would turn it down, just so that Real can turn around and say to Mbappe, \\'look, this is how much we wanted you. We\\'re even willing to spend this much when you\\'ve got a year left on your contract\\'. \"Real are getting ready for next summer, but the only problem for Leonardo is that Mbappe has given his word to PSG that he\\'ll never leave the club for free.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  French football expert Tom Williams: \"I think this is a huge game-changer. In light of what Leonardo has said to the French media, I think Mbappe is closer now to joining Real Madrid within this summer transfer window than he is to staying at PSG. Leonardo has said that Mbappe wants to leave and it\\'s the first time that anyone at PSG has confirmed that. \"He\\'s said that PSG don\\'t want to sell and that\\'s been their stance all along. He\\'s also said that if any player wants to leave, then the club won\\'t stand in their way provided their valuation is met. He\\'s basically paving the way for Real Madrid to come back in with another bid. \"Assuming their bid matches what PSG are holding out for, then I think we could see Mbappe standing on the Bernabeu pitch with a Real Madrid shirt within the next week.\" The £250,000 is up for grabs with Super 6, and as always it is completely free to play.

      "In this specific case, given it is Daniel Levy involved as Tottenham chairman, and his reputation, and the fact that it emerged there was no release clause in his contract, then that would have been a really worrying sign for Harry Kane.\n",
      "So in the back of his mind, he would have always felt that this was a possibility.\n",

      "He wants more of that and if Tottenham are way off the pace, then that's the driving factor for him wanting away for the last year or so.\n",
      "What good might come of this from a Kane perspective is, we've seen some players move on this summer, we've seen Paratici come in with a new manager as well.\n",
      "So is there a chance to start building something and start trying to work towards something?\n",
      "To try and clear out some of the players who maybe don't quite fit into that way the club wants to go and can they try and get back to being competitive?\n",

      "There's no guarantee that won't be the case - although, equally, they could have another season like they did last year and it's even more of a problem.\n",
      "Nobody can predict what way football is going to go so that's why getting him on board and drawing a line under this for all parties is just a really positive development from a club point of view.\n",
      "Next summer Erling Haaland has a release clause of £64m.\n",
      "Next summer Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe are available on free transfers.\n",
      "Next summer Kane will turn 29.\n",
      "Do those circumstances suggest he has missed his chance for a big move away from Tottenham?\n",
      "Gilmour: It is possible but again circumstances can change so much in football that everything is different again by this time next summer.\n",
      "If you remember back in May, when we first reported that Kane had told Daniel Levy he wanted to leave this summer, the three clubs that wanted to sign him were Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea.\n",
      "Now Chelsea, that was always a non-starter given the rivalry of the clubs and that Chelsea have since got sorted with Romelu Lukaku.\n",
      "But one thing I've been told consistently is United might be in a better position to go for someone like Kane next summer.\n",
      "If Kane's still a Tottenham player this season then Manchester United come into play more for next summer.\n",
      "So there's always something else that crops up and a lot of it depends on strikers elsewhere and where they go.\n",
      "Where will Haaland go, for example, that might just have an impact on where Kane ends up.\n",
      "So it's fascinating but it's one of those ones where we have to wait and see how that domino effect begins to take shape over the next six months to a year.\n",
